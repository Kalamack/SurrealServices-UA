SurrealServices was originally maintained by tabris and saturn on the
IRC network irc.surrealchat.net to be an alternative for other services.

You can contact tabris at tabris@surrealchat.net.

SurrealServices+UA is a fork of the original SurrealServices maintained
by Jordan Songer (rails) and me. We chose to fork SurrealServices due to
our discontent with the rather slow development of SurrealServices. We
also with to somewhat modernize the services package and make it comply
to the IRCv3 standards, which are maintained by the Atheme Project at
the time of writing this.

You can contact rails and me on #srsv.ua on the StaticBox IRC network.

CONFIGURATION TIPS

SrSv does not support ziplinks nor SSL, so it should be hosted on the
same box as the hub, or at least the same local network.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
NUMBER OF PROCESSES

We recommend that you leave the "procs" setting at 4 for
uniprocessor and dual processor servers.  Our benchmarks have
shown that increasing it above 4 does not provide any benefit.

You may set "procs" to 0 for use on shell servers with a
limit on the number of background processes. Be aware that
certain SecurityBot features may cause unacceptable lag when
running in single-process mode. This issue will be fixed in a
future release.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
MODULE CONFIGURATION

"country" must be loaded AFTER services, and requires that you run
country-table.pl before using it.

We recommend you run country-table.pl daily in crontab.

"geoip" is like country, but:
a) a much larger set of tables.
b) should not be loaded with country.
c) requires utils/geoip.pl to be run at least once.
d) Don't bother running geoip.pl more often than monthly in a crontab.
e) the datafiles are generally updated on the first of the month
f) geoip uses GeoLite City from MaxMind. We do not grant you a license to use it
   and are not responsible for any consequences of your using it.
