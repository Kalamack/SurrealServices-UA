%BChanServ JOIN%B requests ChanServ to join you to the
channel. If you have channel access, the bot will also give
you an invite, to bypass any bans or other restrictive
channel modes.

If you are not allowed to join the channel, you will not
join.

Syntax: %BJOIN%B %U#channel%U [%U#channel%U [%U#channel%U]]
