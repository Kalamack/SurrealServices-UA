%BChanServ CLOSE%B clears all users, bans *!*@*, and
closes the channel down permanently. This process is not
currently reversible, the channel must be dropped to be
re-opened.

The founder is unchanged, and the oper who closes the
channel becomes successor, in case the founder nick is
dropped.

Syntax: %BCLOSE%B %U#channel%U <%Ureason%U>

Requires SERVOP.
