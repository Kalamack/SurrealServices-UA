SurrealServices+UA 0.1 TODO

[ ] Fix any pre-existing bugs and clean the code up.
[ ] Make the existing code IRCv3 compliant.

Ideas:

* Make it work without MySQL.
* Modularize everything.
* Make everything more configurable.
* tabris left some #FIXME comments throughout the old code. Maybe we should fix it.
